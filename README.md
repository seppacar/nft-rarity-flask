# NFT Rarity Tool

This is an application that I created just for fun using Flask with Python a little CSS and most importantly Opensea API, There are many things missing I will (hopefully) fix them over time.
##### Formula that I used to calculate rarity value for every trait is 
>1 / (Count of particular trait in the collection) / (Total trait count for the trait type)
